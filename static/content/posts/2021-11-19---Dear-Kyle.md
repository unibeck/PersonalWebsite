I am proud of you. You are brave for protecting yourself and your community. You helped anyone who answered your call. 
We need more people like you in this world. You are a hero for what you did for your community, as well as the 
Second Amendment. And while there is every reason to celebrate your win, two men died that night, and you have to carry 
the burden of that. Human life is precious, though I hope you can take solace that their lives were not as whole as 
God intended. That night they were deranged and their past criminal history were vile. I hope you can move past this and 
best of luck in your future endeavors.
