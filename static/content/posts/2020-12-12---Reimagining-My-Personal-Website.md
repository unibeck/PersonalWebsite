Think back to when you were younger for a minute. Remember the good ole times playing video games and how amazing the 
graphics were? Now, if you go look up one of those games you will find that your nostalgic goggles have deceived you. 
There is this weird phenomenon where games do not look as good as we remember them. I share that same sentiment with 
my personal website.

## Prelude
Back in my sophomore year of college I started to look at internships. I realized I needed more experience, a way to 
separate myself from the others, and something to showcase and market myself (other than a resume). Like others in my 
situation, I turned to a personal website to achieve my goal. I ended up building my website using AngularJS and 
Firebase -- no templates, right from scratch. I was, and still am, very proud of what I made. It served as the 
bellwether of what I was capable of and opened several opportunities in my young career.

However, as I alluded to earlier, I now feel like the style and architecture is out-of-date.
