Jonathan Beckman is one part angler, one part carpenter, and a generous dash of DevOps Engineer. Jonathan works 
at Jahnel Group (JG), a top consulting firm, shaping several companies' SDLC processes. Most recently he reduced the 
duration of building out production environments so that clients can go live quicker. This involved managing a 
220+ VM migration to Chef Automate. He also helps lead JG's Architecture Review Board (ARB) and oversees JG's Atlanta 
office initiative.

Mr. Beckman started his career in 2015 gaining valuable experience as a Software Engineer intern. Once he graduated in 
May 2017, Jonathan took his talents to Jahnel Group. Over the next three years, he worked his way up from Full Stack 
Developer to Senior DevOps Engineer. Jonathan attributes his strong and pragmatic leadership, comprehensive process 
governance, and attention to detail to his success.

When Jonathan is not working, you can find him outside enjoying what mother Earth has to offer. He loves to fish with 
his girlfriend, ride ATV/UTVs with his buddies, and hunt in solitude. Jonathan enjoys meeting new people and building 
ever-lasting connections. Please reach out and share your story as well!
