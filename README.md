# JonBeckman Website

My own personal website to  connect with anyone. It describes who I am, what I do, where I work, and all of my projects.

## Get Started
* Change to the project root directory
* Get the firebase tools
    `npm install -g firebase-tools`
* Login to firebase
    `firebase login --interactive`
* To deploy (which you shouldn't need to because CI will take care of this)
    `firebase deploy`
